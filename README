RSA.py: simple "educational" implementation of the RSA encryption and
digital sign algorithm.  No optimizations, no tight security.

Requires python version >= 2.5 and < 3.0.

Existing documentation is in the docstrings of RSA.py.

There is no installation procedure.

The RSA.py testsuite requires pytest >= 2.0.  You can run the whole
testsuite with the command "py.test" issued from the top directory
of the source tree.

The Makefile provide a 'check' target to run the testsuite, a 'dist'
target to repackage the module in a tarball, plus an obvious 'clean'
target.
