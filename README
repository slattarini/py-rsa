RSA.py: simple "educational" implementation of the RSA encryption and
digital sign algorithm.  No optimizations, no tight security.

Requires python version >= 2.5 and < 3.0.

Existing documentation is in the docstrings of RSA.py.

There is no installation procedure.

You can run the RSA.py testsuite through the script 'runtest.py'. It
will require the 'pytest' module.

The Makefile provide a 'check' target to run the testsuite, a 'dist'
target to repackage the module in a tarball, plus an obvious 'clean'
target.
