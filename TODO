TODO list for py-rsa

 * make py-rsa really work with padding

 * implement a real padding scheme in py-rsa

 * make py-rsa work with data encoded in base64
 
 * implement digital signature (using sha-512 and md5 provided by
   the 'hashlib' python's standard module)
 
 * make the "Encrypter" objects of py-rsa work with iterators.

 * [MAYBE] implement key generation (no clue yet about how to do it,
           and it might be difficult).
